# pokemon_assemble
This game structure involves selecting and assembling a team of Pokemon, each with distinct types. The battle sequence is determined by the order of the Pokemon types. Battles consist of attacks, defenses, and HP loss based on various attributes. The game continues until one team is empty, focusing on implementing classes, inheritance, and using stack and queue ADTs in Python. The tasks assess knowledge of abstract and derived classes, stack and queue implementations, and coding quality. Documentation and unit testing are emphasized throughout the development process.
